#Plan for the Project (Weather Analysis using Big Data)

For analyzing the data that we have, a map-reduce programming model is implemented for processing the data. The data is acquired through weather sensors that collects the data through various parameters like longitude, latitude, precipitation, humidity. The weather data is usually huge in volume and might be semi-structured and record-oriented.
Big data is currently a topic of fascination for many facets of society, and the meteorological institute is no exception. Big data analytics will therefore produce better results for weather forecasting and assist forecasters in providing more accurate weather predictions. Several big data techniques and technologies have been proposed to manage and analyze the enormous volume of weather data from various resources in order to accomplish this goal and to suggest beneficial solutions.
